        Kinda cheating since these are technically 2 movies (at the moment), but hey, who cares? 
        These movies are a burst of creativity in every aspect, from visuals and music to story and characters. 
        Speaking of visuals, every frame of these movies resembles a comic book panel. 
        <br>There are also some great memes.

        BEST PIXAR MOVIE EASILY!!! There isn't much to elaborate. 
        Pixar has made many great movies, and this is the best of the best. 
        It's one of those movies that you have to watch.</p>

        Powerful movie with a great story. Is it perfect? No. Am I still going to put it in this list? Yes. 
        Is this purely based on nostalgia? Yes.
